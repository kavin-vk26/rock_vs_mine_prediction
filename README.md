# Rock and Mine Prediction

This project uses machine learning to classify whether an object is a **rock** or a **mine** based on provided data features. It is a beginner-friendly project to understand machine learning workflows, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Training and evaluating machine learning models.
- Predictions on unseen data.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Open `Rock_n_Mine_Prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
2. Execute the cells step by step to:
   - Load and preprocess the data.
   - Train machine learning models.
   - Evaluate performance and make predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains labeled examples indicating whether the input data corresponds to a rock or a mine.

## Results
The model achieves a satisfactory accuracy on the test dataset. Detailed performance metrics can be found in the notebook.
